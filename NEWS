dendextendRcpp 0.3.0 (2013-08-20)
----------------------------
NEW R FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * cut_lower_fun - overrides dendextend function - will give a 4-16 times faster cutree(h) function for R!

NEW RCPP FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * Rcpp_cut_lower (+find_dend_for_height).
      This function changes the output of the nodes to be of dendrogram class
      which enables the fast operation of functions on them!

dendextendRcpp 0.2.1 (2013-08-20)
----------------------------
OTHER NOTES:
   * added zzz.r file - with code to override dendextend functions in case dendextendRcpp is loaded AFTER dendextend.
   * fixed Rcpp_labels_dendrogram works test - adjusting for the new "warn" parameter.

dendextendRcpp 0.2.0 (2013-08-19)
----------------------------

NEW R FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * get_branches_heights - overrides dendextend function dendextend:::get_branches_heights function.
   * heights_per_k.dendrogram - gives a 10 to 130(!) faster loading times.

NEW RCPP FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * get_height
   * push_back_heights
   * Rcpp_get_dend_heights
   * Rcpp_k_per_height
   * Rcpp_k_per_heights (plural)

OTHER NOTES:
   * Moved "is" function to a new file called "is_functions.cpp".
Created a "is_functions.hpp" file for it, and made sure to call it from "labels_dendrogram.cpp"
   * moved labels.dendrogram to a new file labels_dendrogram.r
    
BUG FIXES
   * labels.dendrogram - now returns a label also if the tree is just a leaf.

THE PACKAGE IS NOW RENAMED:
   * from RcppDend to dendextendRcpp - in order to have it easier to remember (at least for me).

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * labels.dendrogram - added warn=FALSE

dendextendRcpp 0.1.1 (2013-08-17)
