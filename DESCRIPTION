Description: This package offers faster manipulation of dendrogram objects in
    R. A dendrogram object in R are is a list structure with attributes in its
    nodes and leaves. Working with dendrogram objects often require a function
    to recursively go through all (or most) element in the list object.
    Naturally, such function are rather slow in R, but can become much faster
    thank to Rcpp.
